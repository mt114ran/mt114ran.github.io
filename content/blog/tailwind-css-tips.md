# Tailwind CSS Tips and Tricks

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of Tailwind CSS.

## Use the @apply Directive

The `@apply` directive allows you to extract common utility patterns into custom CSS classes:

```css
.btn {
  @apply px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600;
}
```

## Responsive Design

Tailwind makes it easy to build responsive designs with its mobile-first approach:

```html
<div class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
  This text changes size at different breakpoints.
</div>
```

## Dark Mode

Tailwind CSS v2.0 introduced built-in dark mode support:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-black dark:text-white">
  This div changes colors in dark mode.
</div>
```

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS is a powerful tool for building modern, responsive web applications. With these tips and tricks, you can take your Tailwind CSS skills to the next level.
