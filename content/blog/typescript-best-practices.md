# TypeScript Best Practices

TypeScript is a powerful language that adds static typing to JavaScript. Here are some best practices to help you write better TypeScript code.

## Use Strict Mode

Enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` file to catch more errors at compile time:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Use Type Inference

TypeScript has powerful type inference capabilities. Use them to your advantage:

```typescript
// TypeScript can infer the type of `x` as number
const x = 5;

// TypeScript can infer the return type as number
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## Use Interface for Object Types

Use interfaces to define the shape of objects:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function getUser(id: number): User {
  // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful tool for building robust applications. By following these best practices, you can write more maintainable and error-free code.
